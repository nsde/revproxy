# PRIVACY SETTINGS

# the following setting values can help to protect privacy of the proxy and client.
# please keep in mind that these settings can break some websites.

# values can be either:
# - "expose" (use the real IP)
# - "obfuscate" (randomly generated IP)
# - "localhost" (sets the IP to 127.0.0.1)

# IP of the proxy server itself. 
server-ip: 

# IP of the target server where the request is forwarded to
# Anything other than "expose" will break a lot of websites!
target-ip: expose

# IP of the client who made the request
client-ip: obfuscate

# If set to true, all requests will use the "X-Forwarded-For" header to expose the client IP to the target server.
expose-client-ip: false

# PROXY SETTINGS
# Please specify the proxy settings in your .env file.
# Read the documentation for more information.
# All tunnels will use the specified proxy, unless "proxy" is set to "false" on the corresponding tunnel.
